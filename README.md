Advance in  NLP Library

# What's spaCy?

SpaCy is **free**, **open-source library** for advanced **Natural language processing**(NLP) in Python.

Suppose you're working with a lot of text, you'll eventually want to know more about it. For example, what's it about? What does the words mean in the context? Who is doing what to whom? What products and compnaies are mentioned in the text? Which texts are simmilar to each other.

spaCy is designed specifically for **production use** and helps you build applications that process and "understand" large volume of text. It can be used to build **information extraction** or **natural language processing** systems, or to pre-process text for **deep learning**.
